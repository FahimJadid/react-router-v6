### Welcome to the React Router V6

We'll be building a small, but feature-rich app that lets you keep track of your contacts. We expect it to take between 30-60m if you're following along.

# Setup

- Open up your terminal and bootstrap a new React app with Vite:

```bash
    npm create vite@latest name-of-your-project -- --template react

    # follow prompts

    cd <your new project directory>
    npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by
    npm run dev
```

- You should be able to visit the URL printed in the terminal:

VITE v3.0.7 ready in 175 ms

➜ Local: http://127.0.0.1:5173/
➜ Network: use --host to expose

- Or you can just clone this repo and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to get started.
